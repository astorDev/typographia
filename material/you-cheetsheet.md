# Material 3 (You) Typography Cheatsheet

> By default `Roboto` typeface is used for all the "tokens".

> `Medium` is a slightly bolder then `Regular`.

## Display

> As the largest text on the screen, display styles are reserved for short, important text or numerals. They work best on large screens.  

| Token              | Font Size | Weight   |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| Display Large      | 57px      | Regular  |
| Display Medium     | 45px      | Regular  |
| Display Small      | 36px      | Regular  |

## Headline

> Headlines are best-suited for short, high-emphasis text on smaller screens. These styles can be good for marking primary passages of text or important regions of content.

| Token              | Font Size | Weight   |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| Headline Large     | 32px      | Regular  |
| Headline Medium    | 28px      | Regular  |
| Headline Small     | 24px      | Regular  |

## Titles

> Titles are smaller than headline styles, and should be used for medium-emphasis text that remains relatively short. For example, consider using title styles to divide secondary passages of text or secondary regions of content.

| Token              | Font Size | Weight   |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|

| Title Medium       | 16px      | Medium   |
| Title Small        | 14px      | Medium   |

## Body

> Body styles are used for longer passages of text in your app. 

| Token              | Font Size | Weight   |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| Body Large         | 16px      | Regular  |
| Body Medium        | 14px      | Regular  |
| Body Small         | 12px      | Regular  |

## Label

> Label styles are smaller, utilitarian styles, used for things like the text inside components or for very small text in the content body, such as captions. 

| Token              | Font Size | Weight   |
